		COUNT() 
			SELECT * FROM customers
			WHERE amount > 300000;

			SELECT COUNT(column) FROM customers
			WHERE amount > 300000;

			SELECT * FROM customers
			WHERE firstname = "aung";

			SELECT COUNT(firstname) FROM customers
			WHERE firstname = "aung";

		SUM() 
			SELECT * FROM customers
			WHERE amount > 300000;

			SELECT SUM(amount) FROM customers
			WHERE amount > 300000;

			SELECT * FROM customers
			WHERE city = "mandalay";

			SELECT SUM(amount) FROM customers
			WHERE city = "mandalay";

		AVG() 
			SELECT * FROM customers
			WHERE city = "yangon";

			SELECT AVG(amount) FROM customers
			WHERE city = "yangon";
